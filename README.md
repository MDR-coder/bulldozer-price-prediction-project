# bulldozer-price-prediction-project
An end to end ML project to predict the future prices of bulldozers based on past data.
This is a Time Series Regression Project that was created while following the Complete Machine Learning & Data Science Bootcamp by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke. 
I have made some of the suggested changes from the course in which the order of manipulation of the dataset, and preparing it for training the model was slightly wrong.
This project utilizes the scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
